          <p class="centred_text">
            Domestic Shorthair cats are not a specific breed. They're a diverse group of mixed-breed cats with short coats. Known for their adaptability and affectionate nature.
            They come in a wide range of colors, patterns, and sizes. These cats typically have muscular builds and require minimal grooming due to their sleek, dense fur.
            Domestic Shorthairs are generally healthy and resilient thanks to their varied genetic background, and they often live 12 to 20 years with proper care.
            Their personalities can vary widely: Some are playful and energetic, while others are calm and cuddly, making them excellent companions for families, singles, and seniors alike.
